            <td>What are my favorite games?</td>
            <td>I prefer high interaction strategy games - my current favorite is Dune Imperium, but I love playing a round of Sidereal Confluence when enough people are interested</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What games am I learning?</td>
            <td>I'm picking up Twilight Struggle, a two-player cold war era wargame (think a more complicated and less dice roll focused version of risk), and Pax Renaissance, a renaissance era game about trade, religion, and prestige</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What about Catan, Monopoly, etc.?</td>
            <td>While I enjoy these games, I find modern board games to be more skill expressive and have more intereseting decision spaces</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What game should I play to explore more modern board games?</td>
            <td>Of the ones I've played, I would recommend Irish Gauge (a train game) and Race for the Galaxy (an iconic card space-age card game)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Are there games you can play solo?</td>
            <td>Yes, but I prefer to compete with others. Many games have an "AI" player in the form of a random decision deck.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What do you do if you have too many players at a board game night?</td>
            <td>Some lower stakes games that are more inclusive: liars dice and wizard!</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Modern board games are way more expensive than I thought - what should I do?</td>
            <td>Yes, popular modern board games can be anywhere from 40-100 USD. People are collectors though, so buying used is the way to go! I've gotten some of my favorite games for 80-20% off.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What games am I looking to get next?</td>
            <td>I would love terraforming mars and gaia project, but I have enough for now.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>It's just me and one other person, what games should I get?</td>
            <td>An easy 2-player designed game I like is 7 Wonders Duel. It's a quick 20 minute card drafting
                game that has an interesting decision space without being overly complicated. I've played with my parents!

        <tr>
            <td>Where can I buy games?</td>
            <td>For new - your best bet is probably Amazon as many of the games come from obscure publishers. Some of the more popular (but still not super mainstream) games will be at Barnes and Noble. For a more comprehensive collection, look for a board game store near you!
                However, I strongly recommend looking on Facebook marketplace. You can get a good idea of the games to buy from reddit.
